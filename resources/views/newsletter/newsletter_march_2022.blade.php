                        <h3>About SheTrades.com</h3>
                        <p>Women’s economic empowerment has appeared on the global development agenda for two decades, however, the 
                          business and economic cases are still not formulated fully. In 2015, consultations with global thought leaders
                          revealed persisting silos between relevant actors and the components of women’s enterprise development: 
                          gender-disaggregated research, inclusive policy, skills development, access to markets and finance. Women’s 
                          economic empowerment is not a matter for government policy, the private sector, or social change alone. All 
                          have critical roles to play. This is why ITC launched the SheTrades initiative, which seeks to connect three 
                          million women entrepreneurs to market by 2021. 
                        </p><br>

                        <h3>Market analysis tools</h3>
                        <p>Users from developing countries and territories as well as the European Union can use all features and 
                          functionality including the bulk data download option free of charge. Most of the content in the International 
                          Trade Centre’s (ITC) Market Analysis Tools is free for all users. The tools enable companies and trade support 
                          institutions to identify export and import opportunities and compare market-access requirements, and they help 
                          policymakers monitor national trade performance and prepare for trade negotiations. 
                          ITC has developed online tools – Trade Map, Market Access Map, Investment Map, Trade Competitiveness Map, Export 
                          Potential Map, Procurement Map and Sustainability Map – that collectively help improve transparency in 
                          international trade. To access the tools register at the portal, https://marketanalysis.intracen.org/en

                          ITC is also part of a multi-agency initiative to make trade information more accessible for MSMEs through the 
                          Global Trade Helpdesk.

                        <h3>Trade Competitiveness Map</h3> 
                        <p>
                          Governments need to monitor trade performance in order to provide adequate trade policy support to small and 
                          medium-sized enterprises. Trade and Investment Support Institutions (TISIs) have to identify the right 
                          sectors on which to spend specific sector-development strategy. Firms need to scan global markets for product 
                          and market diversification opportunities. Trade Competitiveness Map makes it easier for all three sets of actors 
                          to conduct strategic market research, monitor national export performance and design trade development programs.
